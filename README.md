### Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

---

#### Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn within the telecom industry to identify key drivers and provide actionable strategies for improving customer retention. Using a dataset that includes demographic, service usage, and account information, the analysis focuses on factors such as payment methods, contract types, tenure, and other contributing elements.

---

#### Objective
The main goal of this project is to uncover patterns and correlations in customer churn and address:
- Major factors influencing customer churn.
- Strategies to enhance customer retention and reduce churn rates.

#### Key Findings

1. **Contract Type and Churn**  
   - Customers with *month-to-month contracts* exhibit a high churn rate of 42%, while yearly and two-year contracts have churn rates of 11% and 3%, respectively.  
   - **Actionable Insight:** Encourage customers to switch to long-term contracts by offering incentives and loyalty rewards.

2. **Payment Methods and Churn**  
   - Customers using *electronic checks* have the highest churn rate at 45%, compared to 15-18% for credit cards, bank transfers, and mailed checks.  
   - **Actionable Insight:** Promote secure and reliable payment methods like credit cards and bank transfers through targeted campaigns.

3. **Churn by Tenure**  
   - Churn is highest (50%) among customers with a tenure of less than one year, decreasing to 15% after three years.  
   - **Actionable Insight:** Focus on customer engagement and support during the first year to improve satisfaction and retention.

4. **Internet Service Type**  
   - Customers using *fiber optic services* show a churn rate of 30%, higher than the 20% churn rate for DSL services.  
   - **Actionable Insight:** Investigate issues related to fiber optic services, such as speed and reliability, to address potential dissatisfaction.

5. **Senior Citizens and Churn**  
   - Senior citizens (aged 65+) have a churn rate of 41%, compared to 26% for non-senior customers.  
   - **Actionable Insight:** Develop personalized assistance programs or discounts tailored to senior customers.

#### Visualizations

- **Bar Charts and Line Graphs:** Display churn trends by contract type, payment method, tenure, and internet service type. These visualizations highlight key disparities and patterns.
- **Percentage Distributions:**  
  - *Payment Methods:* 45% churn for electronic check users, 15% for credit card users.  
  - *Contract Types:* 42% churn for month-to-month plans, 11% for yearly, and 3% for two-year contracts.  
  - *Tenure:* Churn decreases significantly after the first year.
